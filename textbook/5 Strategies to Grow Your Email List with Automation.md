## 5 Ways to Grow Your Email List with Automation

Remember, automation won‚Äôt work unless people are actively entering the start of your automation funnel. Always guide users to your website or blog, where they can interact with your subscription incentives.

### 1. Create a ‚ÄúFree Resources‚Äù Page

On my **Bloggaajasta Ammattilaiseksi‚Ñ¢** website, I‚Äôve consolidated a few free guides and courses onto a single ‚ÄúFree Resources‚Äù page. I‚Äôve also added a link to this page in the top navigation menu so it‚Äôs visible to every visitor. You can track link clicks with tools like PrettyLink to see how often the page is visited.

Here are some ideas for naming your page:
- Free / Free Tools
- Free / Free Resources
- Free / Free Guides
- Free / Free Courses

Even if you only offer one subscription incentive, having a dedicated page ensures visibility. I recommend limiting the number of incentives to three, as too many options can make it harder to identify which one performs best.

### 2. Use an Alert Bar

An **alert bar** at the top of your website is another effective way to grow your list. Some website themes come with built-in alert bar functionality. Since I use **Leadpages**, I leverage their alert bar feature. It works especially well for promoting events like webinars, workshops, or free courses. Here's a quick preview of how an alert bar might look:

### 3. Leverage Organic Social Media

Organic social media, especially Instagram Stories, has been one of my favorite channels for driving sign-ups. By including a direct link to the landing page in Stories, I‚Äôve achieved impressive conversion rates. For instance, during a recent webinar campaign, 87.6% of participants came via Instagram Stories, and 99% of those who clicked the link signed up.

Although less effective, you can also use feed posts to highlight your subscription offers and direct people to your profile link.

### 4. Write SEO-Optimized Blog Posts

I‚Äôve been using my blog to grow my email list for years. While blog posts generate steady growth at a slower pace, the process is fully automated. By optimizing your posts for SEO, you can attract readers from Google, who then join your email list without any additional costs. Include banners in your blog posts to guide visitors toward subscribing.

### 5. Use a Sidebar Form

Don‚Äôt forget the sidebar! While sidebars are less visible on mobile devices, they are still effective for desktop users. Place your subscription incentive among the first three elements in the sidebar to maximize attention.

I recommend updating your sidebar content monthly to keep it fresh and engaging for repeat visitors.

### +6. Add Pop-Ups

While pop-ups don‚Äôt always deliver high sign-up rates, they‚Äôre worth considering as an additional strategy. Use timed pop-ups (e.g., after 30 seconds) or exit-intent pop-ups, which appear when a visitor is about to leave your website.
