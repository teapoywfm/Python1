## The Truth About Affiliate Marketing

Many of us dream of earning money effortlessly, with minimal work. While this idea might seem like an illusion, Iâ€™ve found a way to make automated or passive income truly passive. Youâ€™ll need two things for this, one of which you likely already have.

The second thing, which you might not have yet, is a **subscription-based affiliate product**.

### What is a Subscription-Based Affiliate Product?

A subscription affiliate product is a service that customers pay for on a recurring monthly basis. As long as the customer keeps paying for the product, you receive a commission.

For instance, platforms like [LeadPages](https://bit.ly/LEadPages) and Clickfunnels are great examples of subscription-based affiliate products. However, thereâ€™s a catch: commissions from these products are relatively small. For example, LeadPages pays approximately â‚¬4.90 for every new customer you refer. Referring 100 new customers means earning â‚¬490 in commissions each month.

To achieve substantial results with such programs, youâ€™ll need to consistently recruit 20â€“100 new people into the program every month. If waiting isnâ€™t an option for you, keep reading.

Because letâ€™s face it, we want to make money **easily**, donâ€™t we?

## The Lazy Person's Affiliate Marketing Tip

Affiliate marketing shouldnâ€™t be solely about chasing money. To make others believe in you and the product youâ€™re promoting, you must understand and genuinely like the product yourself. Ideally, you should purchase the product, but thatâ€™s not always feasible since some products cost thousands of euros.

Recently, I discovered a training program that ticks several important boxes:

- **Low initial investment** (less than â‚¬10)
- A **15-day training** that teaches how to build a successful digital business in todayâ€™s world
- Afterward, you can start promoting this same training program

Why is this a good option?

Because all you need to do is get people to pay â‚¬10 for the 15-day training, and the company handles the rest. The business takes care of selling additional courses and products. This means you can gain maximum benefit with minimal effort.

By completing the 15-day training yourself, youâ€™ll gain valuable insights into digital marketing and how it works today. These lessons will help you attract more potential customers (leads) to the company. When your referred customers purchase advanced training, youâ€™ll earn commissions without doing any extra work. This program combines high-ticket affiliate marketing and subscription-based affiliate marketing into one convenient package.

## Where to Promote Your Affiliate Links

Now that you know the product, the next step is figuring out where and how to promote it. Many suggest platforms like TikTok, Reels, or YouTube videos. However, not everyone feels comfortable creating video content or showing their face online. Others may not be strong writers, which can make it tempting to give up before starting.

This brings us to the **second part of my tip**: the laziest way to promote your affiliate link is to include it in your email signature.

At first, people might not click the link. But over time, curiosity will win out. Trust me, Iâ€™ve left my affiliate link in my email signature for a few months, and about 15 people have already clicked it and signed up as students.

## Additional Promotion Ideas

If you want to expand beyond email signatures, here are a few other gentle methods to recommend affiliate products:

- Adding affiliate links to your **social media profiles** (e.g., using Linktree or similar tools)
- Embedding links into your **digital products**
- Using **lead magnets** to capture emails and promote your affiliate links

These are subtle ways to recommend subscription-based affiliate products, which allow your commissions to grow steadily month after month and year after year.
